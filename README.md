## 📌 Problem Statement  
VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) calls are widely used because of their low cost and accessibility. Unfortunately, criminals misuse them for *fraud, spam, and cybercrimes*. Traditional methods fail, especially when calls are encrypted.  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution  
🔍 Our system tracks *VoIP calls using network metadata* instead of intercepting content.  

- Collect SIP & RTP metadata (IP addresses, timestamps, call duration, packet size trends)  
- Correlate traffic patterns across networks  
- Use *AI-driven anomaly detection* to identify fraud/spam calls  
- Non-intrusive: Works even with encrypted VoIP  

---

## ⚙ Technical Approach  

### 🛠 Technologies & Tools  
- *Languages & Frameworks:* Python, Scikit-learn  
- *Network Tools:* Wireshark/TShark, Elasticsearch  
- *Protocols:* SIP, RTP/SRTP  
- *Data Sources:* PCAP files, NetFlow/IPFIX  

### 🤖 Machine Learning Methodology  
- *Anomaly Detection*: Isolation Forest, DBSCAN  
- *Pattern Analysis*: Clustering Algorithms  
- *Visualization*: Dashboards & Reports  

---

## 🔬 Methodology  
1. *Data Collection* → Capture SIP headers, call metadata  
2. *Pre-processing* → Extract identifiers, session durations  
3. *Analysis* → Correlate across multiple networks  
4. *ML Models* → Detect anomalies (spam campaigns, spoofing)  
5. *Visualization* → Interactive dashboards  

---

## 🌍 Impact & Benefits  

✅ *Social* – Protects citizens from scam calls  
💰 *Economic* – Reduces telecom fraud losses  
🔒 *Security* – Strengthens national cybercrime prevention
